# Budget-Organizer

Following a tutorial from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and making some changes of my own as I go through it.

The finished product you will be able to add your own items and it will give you a monthly/yearly breakdown of all your expenses. This is just to help me practice better React designing.
