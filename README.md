# Budget-Organizer

Following a tutorial from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and making some changes of my own as I go through it.

This program allows you to log and track all of your expenses that you had throughout the past few years and the future. It gives you a monthly/yearly breakdown of all your expenses with a small chart that easily allows you to see which month had the highest expenses. This is just to help me practice better React designing.

# Code I changed from the tutorial

- Added checks to prevent strings from being empty. An alert box pops up to inform the user of missing requirements.
- Refactored some unnecessary imports and cleaned up some commented code.

# Future features

- Add some animations
- Maybe further in the future, but I'd like to add cookies so it can actually be used properly. Currently, if you refresh the page, all data is lost. However, I am aware I would need more of a backend to achieve this feature.
